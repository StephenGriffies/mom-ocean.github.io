MOM5 is a numerical ocean model based on the hydrostatic primitive equations, making use of the B-grid in the horizontal and generalized level coordinates for the vertical. 

Development is led by scientists at [NOAA/GFDL](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-model) in collaboration with scientists worldwide. Much of the ongoing activity is centred in Australia. 

Version 5 of MOM (MOM5) is an open source project released under the GPL license.  Contributions are welcome.
