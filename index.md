## The Modular Ocean Model (MOM)
MOM is a numerical ocean model based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. MOM development is led by scientists at [NOAA/GFDL](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-model) in collaboration with scientists worldwide. Version 5 of MOM (MOM5) is an open source project released under the GPL license.

The MOM5 ocean model is community supported and widely used in active research.
